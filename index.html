    <h1>ABOUT CORONA VIRUS</h1>
    <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 67, 9);font-size:20px;">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

        Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
         requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older 
         people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory 
         disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become 
         seriously ill or die at any age. 
        
        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus
         spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a
          properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when
           it’s your turn and follow local guidance.
        
        The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze,
         speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is 
         important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and 
         self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.</h2>
